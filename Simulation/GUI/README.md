# ManArm Controller
## Description
This is a controller for a robot that had to be built during an Adaptive Robotics minor
at Fontys University of Applied Sciences.

Goals: 
* Provide a control interface similar to other robot arms on the market
* Support Linux including ARM, optionally windows  
* Save and load robot programs between platforms
* Control of each individual joint and IO pins


This project uses Tkinter as it supports different architectures. This toolkit is beginner friendly 
but also offers advanced features. 

## Work in progress
This project is still in the early stage of development.
