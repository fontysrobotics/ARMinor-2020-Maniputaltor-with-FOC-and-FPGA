# Mechanical Design
For the mechanical design, there were two main parts that were considered:

The manipulator frame:

Aluminium extrusion was hosen for the frame, as this is lightweight, easy to acquire and assemble, and allows for the cables to be hidden.

The manipulator joints:

For the manipulator joints, pre-built joints were found.
These allow minimisation of cost and omplexity, while achieving high performance.

For more details on the components selected and he recommendations, please see the project report.
